   Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell is an American artist/singer, who specializes in producing Alternative and Electropop style music with her voice and brilliant lyrics. She had a passion for dance and music, which were all involved with her family. Her brother worked on music, so she made the song "Ocean Eyes" so she could dance to it. Little did she know that it sparked something even bigger in the music world.

   <p>
   O'Connell was raised in Highland Park, Los Angeles, to a family of actors and musicians. Her parents are actress-musician-screenwriter Maggie Baird and Patrick O'Connell. She was homeschooled, and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight. At age eleven, Billie began writing and singing her own songs, taking after her older brother Finneas O'Connell who was already writing, performing and producing his own songs with his band. In October 2015, Billie recorded the song "Ocean Eyes", initially written by Finneas for his band, and sent it to her dance teacher who hoped to choreograph a dance to it.
